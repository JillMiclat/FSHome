               <p>Flammable liquids should be stored in tightly sealed, self-closing, spill-proof containers. Refueling gasoline-powered equipment should not be done while it is hot. Only take what you need from the storage drums. Keep flammable liquids away from sparking sources.</p>

               <h2>Class C - Gases</h2>
               <p>Class C fires are those that involve gases. This could include natural gas, LPG, or other gases that create a flammable or explosive atmosphere.</p>
               <p><h4>Best Type of fire extinguisher to put it out:</h4> Powder </p>
               <p> note: when putting out this type of fire, the most vital and safest step is shutting off the gas supply</p>
               <p><h4>✎ How to prevent?</h4>Working with gas is hazardous and increases the risk of a fire. Keep stored gases in sealed containers in a safe storage area, and make sure that gas work is done by qualified people.</p>

               <h2>Class D - Metals</h2>
               <p>Metals are not commonly thought of as combustible materials, but some metals, such as sodium, can be. Metals are also good conductors, which aids in the spread of a fire. At high temperatures, all metals soften and melt, which can cause building collapse when metal joists and columns are present as structural elements in a fire.</p>
               <p><h4>Best Type of fire extinguisher to put it out:</h4> Powder </p>
               <p><h4>✎ How to prevent?</h4>Metals should be kept separate and stored in secure locations or containers. This is especially important for metals that heat up at low temperatures.</p>

            <div class="col-8">
               <h2>Electrical Fires</h2>
               <p>Because electricity is more of a source of ignition than a fuel, this is not strictly a fire class (Class E). Fires in live electrical equipment, on the other hand, pose an additional risk.</p>
               <p><h4>Best Type of fire extinguisher to put it out:</h4> CO2 </p>
               <p><h4>✎ How to prevent?</h4>Ensure that electrical equipment and installations are properly installed, inspected, and maintained to reduce the risk of this type of fire.</p>

            <div class="col-8">
               <h2>Class F - Cooking Fats & Oils</h2>
               <p>Deep fat frying and spilling flammable oils near heat sources in kitchens can cause a Class F fire. This type of fire is most common in commercial kitchens with deep-fat fryers, but it can also occur in residential settings.</p>
               <p><h4>Best Type of fire extinguisher to put it out:</h4> Wet Chemical </p>
               <p>note: a fire blanket could also be used to put out small class F fires.</p>
               <p><h4>✎ How to prevent?</h4>If you see smoke, it's too hot, so turn off the heat immediately. You should also avoid using too much oil or fat, and never fill a pan more than one-third full. And, as with any other type of cooking, avoid leaving things to cook unattended or becoming distracted yourself.</p>
